# Amazon_Reviews_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
For the project I picked the Video Game Reviews from the amazon datasets, by extracting the data, cleaning the data, and then connecting the data to the database generated on AWS. We want to use the data to see if there is any bias with Vine members in giving a good review.

## Results
### Total Vine and Non-vine 5 star Reviews
