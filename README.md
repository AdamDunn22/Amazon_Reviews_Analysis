# Amazon_Reviews_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
For the project I picked the Video Game Reviews from the amazon datasets, by extracting the data, cleaning the data, and then connecting the data to the database generated on AWS. We want to use the data to see if there is any bias with Vine members in giving a good review.

## Results
* Total Vine and Non-vine Reviews
  * There are 94 Vine Reviews, and 40471 Non-Vine Reviews

* Total and Percentage of 5 Star Vine and Non-Vine Reviews
  * Out of the 94 Vine reviews, 48 of them were 5 stars (51.06%). Of the 40471 Non-Vine Reviews, 15663 of them were 5 star reviews (38.70%)

## Summary
Overall our results show that there is a bias with being a vine member and the likely hood that you would leave a positive review. Although we should note that it is a small sample of Vine users as there is only 94 Vine Reviews out of 65379 reviews, so we have a very small amount of data.
